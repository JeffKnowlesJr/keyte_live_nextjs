                                <blockquote>"We were always struggling to find times to do things. The sheer amount of STUFF that occurs: ordering prescription refills, physical therapy, etc. Now we go about our daily tasks in a more organized fashion and are able to focus on true headaches, problems, and recurring issues. As a result, we are able to do more good things for our patients and ourselves." <cite> Office manager, large physician practice</cite></blockquote>
