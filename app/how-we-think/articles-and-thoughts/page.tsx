                    <p className="article-meta">Harvard Business Review Online, 2017</p>
                    <p>Traditional command-and-control leadership models struggle in today's rapidly changing environment. This piece examines how leaders can develop the coaching and mentoring skills needed to guide organizations through continuous transformation.</p>

                    <h3>Beyond Waste Elimination: Creating Flow</h3>
                    <p className="article-meta">Lean Enterprise Institute, 2016</p>
                    <p>While eliminating waste is important, the real power of lean thinking lies in creating flow. We discuss how organizations can move beyond waste reduction to build systems that naturally flow toward value creation.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                  <p>Our articles and thoughts consistently explored several key themes:</p>
                  <h3>Practical Application</h3>
                  <p>We focused on real-world application rather than theoretical concepts. Every article included practical examples and actionable insights that readers could immediately apply in their organizations.</p>
                  <h3>People-Centered Approach</h3>
                  <p>Technology and tools are important, but sustainable improvement always comes through people. Our writing emphasized engaging employees, developing capability, and creating cultures of continuous improvement.</p>
                  <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
                  <p>Individual improvements are valuable, but transformational results require systems thinking. We explored how to see connections, understand interdependencies, and optimize whole systems rather than individual parts.</p>
                  <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
                  <p>Successful lean transformations require leaders who can coach, mentor, and guide rather than command and control. Many of our articles focused on developing these essential leadership capabilities.</p>
                  <h2>Industry Publications</h2>
                  <p>Our work appeared in various industry publications and forums:</p>
