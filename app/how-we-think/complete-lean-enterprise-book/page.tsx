                      "The Complete Lean Enterprise is an excellent tool to
                      guide the enterprising manager to a new lean process
                      solution. The step-by-step instructions are easy for the
                      beginner to follow, and the lean examples, team exercises,
                      and mapping tips add a credible voice of experience to the
                      manuscript. And, best of all, 'It works!'"
