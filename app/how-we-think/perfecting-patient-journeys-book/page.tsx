                  <p>
                    Over the past eight years, the authors of this book have
                    helped healthcare organizations learn how to make real and
                    sustainable change using the value-stream improvement
                    method. Implementing lean thinking has helped healthcare
                    providers develop an adaptive, problem-solving culture with
                    notable results:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Reduced annual staff turnover by 20%</li>
                    <li>
                      Average length of stay (LOS) in a large emergency
                      department was reduced by 30%
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The number of patients who left without being seen (LWOBS)
                      dropped by 60% in the same hospital
                    </li>
                    <li>Customer (patient) satisfaction increased by 73%</li>
                    <li>
                      Operating room changeover time was reduced, which
                      increased the number of surgical procedures performed by
                      20%
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    The method described here does not rely on huge training
                    budgets or teams of consultants. It focuses on solving real
                    organizational problems, and at the end of the day doing
                    what healthcare organizations and those who labor there
                    aspire to do every day: provide safe, effective, efficient,
                    and timely patient care.

                      "We have found in healthcare organizations throughout
                      North America that this approach unleashes the talent and
                      creativity of thousands of workers all focused on solving
                      problems every day. The result? Remarkably higher-quality,
                      lower-cost care. Given the worldwide problem of declining
                      value in healthcare I cannot think of a more timely and
                      practical resource for pursuing perfect health care
                      delivery."

                    <p>
                      "In healthcare it is difficult to see the entire process
                      in one's own department, never mind fully understand what
                      the patients and families experience as they receive care
                      throughout the hospital. Hospitals, like many companies,
                      are set up in separate and distinct departments so a
                      patient must enter and exit these distinct vertical silos
                      even for a simple doctor's visit and face even more
                      fragmentation for an inpatient stay. This book helps one
                      to 'see' across the silos by teaching you a way to
                      visualize the current flow (or anti-flow) of patients as
                      they navigate their way to better health and in turn,
                      makes obvious the waits and delays, the hand-off issues,
                      the redundancies, and the pain our patients experience so
                      that you can design a much better system of care delivery.
                      Perfecting Patient Journeys provides a step-wise approach
                      that is practical and clear and will jump start efforts of
                      your process improvement teams."
