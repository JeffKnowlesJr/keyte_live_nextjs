                  Lean thinking challenges an organization to examine how its
                  resources are currently deployed. Until they are being used
                  optimally, it's unlikely that adding resources is the best way
                  to grow your organization in a sustainable way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To help quantify things, the metaphor of a bucket can be used.
                  The current "capacity" – how resources are being used in
                  different activities -- can be visualized, and then also how
                  they need to be used to achieve a specific operational goal.
                  This webinar will introduce the capacity bucket, show several
                  quick examples, and then leave you with a straightforward
                  challenge: what do you understand about how you use your
                  capacity today and the resource gaps that challenge your
                  improvement efforts?

                  Most transformative efforts require that top organizational
                  leaders become significantly involved in championing change
                  (with the difficult work of accepting different ways of
                  thinking and acting). When redesigning work for most workers,
                  showing them how to first remove work that no longer makes
                  sense or adds value is important. Leaders should have the same
                  opportunity.

                  This webinar is designed to start you on a path toward doing
                  the right work, and only the right work, as part of your
                  organizational transformation. It will provide you with a
                  template for assessing your current work in a deliberate
                  manner. It will share a process used to challenge the value of
                  ongoing tasks, with an eye-opening example. Once you've worked
                  through this process for yourself and removed work that no
                  longer has value, you will be free to replace it with work
                  that moves the organization forward.

                  When I began my lean thinking journey years ago, my clients
                  were impressed that I could present seemingly brilliant
                  solutions to their problems. And - truth be told - I was too
                  often impressed with myself. It took me years to realize that
                  my solutions were flawed; as a young engineering professional,
                  I hadn't recognized the human limitations of the workplace,
                  hadn't understood how people thought and acted within an
                  existing organizational culture.
