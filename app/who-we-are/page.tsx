            <h1>We Are Hands-On Problem Solvers</h1>
                            <p>We are seasoned practitioners, most of whom also own their own consultancies. Unlike many management consulting companies, we don't have partners selling services and then delegating the actual work to less experienced staff. We have the flexibility to offer the best person for the application you need, and are committed to keeping the right people in front of you at all times.</p>
                            <p>Our network includes professionals in a wide range of disciplines, including policy deployment, lean strategies, shop floor transformations, enterprise transformations, office and service lean, healthcare lean, human resource strategies, lean costing applications, lean metrics, etc.</p>
