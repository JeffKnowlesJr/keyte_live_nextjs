                  "A3" thinking – referencing an industry term for the 11 x 17
                  sheet of paper which serves as the collection point for data
                  and analysis – can turn things around. While one-time training
                  workshops are useful, a progressive learning model, working
                  with several teams in an organization over a series of weeks
                  to allow them time to engage others, gather solid supporting
                  data, and learn how to identify the actionable issue(s) has
                  been found to be the best intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this technique an organization's internal capacity for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Aligning all functions around key strategic performance
                    goals
                  </li>
                  <li>Understanding systemic problems and solving them</li>
                  <li>
                    Creating a solid force of front line thinking and problem
                    solving
                  </li>
                  <li>Continuous improvement</li>

                  The A3 process helps managers develop their teams through
                  coaching and mentoring, enhancing the problem-solving
                  capabilities of operational staff and allowing management to
                  address higher-level organizational issues. This approach
                  fosters systematic thinking and creates a structured way to
                  tackle complex challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our A3 methodology focuses on developing internal
                  problem-solving capacity rather than providing quick fixes,
                  ensuring that organizations build lasting capabilities for
                  continuous improvement.
