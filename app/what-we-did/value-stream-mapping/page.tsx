                <h3>Guiding Organizational Transformation</h3>
                <p>Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a tool (set of tools and techniques) that is/are used to help people learn and change together. We've been mapping processes for 26 years and produced three publications on the subject; we are thought-leaders in the field.</p>
                <p>Whether a project's scope is small or sweeping, the fundamentals are the same. Yet the approach is never cookie-cutter. Teams are coached as they themselves diagnose system performance issues and design something better â€“ delivering better value to the customer and making front line workers better able to do their jobs. Each team, each problem, has qualities that are unique.</p>
                <p>Value Stream Mapping sounds technical and it is. Perhaps even a bit tedious. But it gets to the root of things and opens up the possibility of changing thought and behavior. And then the learning is leveraged.</p>
                <p>That's right: don't stop with the technical stuff. All change has social implications for your organization, and VSM is also a great tool for bringing an organization together in many ways. Changing the work is just the beginning; the management system also needs to adapt to the changes, because the connection between the two is critical to sustaining improvements.</p>
