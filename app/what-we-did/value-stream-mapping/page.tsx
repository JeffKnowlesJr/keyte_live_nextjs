                <h3>Guiding Organizational Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                  Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a tool (set of tools and
                  techniques) that is/are used to help people learn and change
                  together. We've been mapping processes for 26 years and
                  produced three publications on the subject; we are
                  thought-leaders in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether a project's scope is small or sweeping, the
                  fundamentals are the same. Yet the approach is never
                  cookie-cutter. Teams are coached as they themselves diagnose
                  system performance issues and design something better â€“
                  delivering better value to the customer and making front line
                  workers better able to do their jobs. Each team, each problem,
                  has qualities that are unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Value Stream Mapping sounds technical and it is. Perhaps even
                  a bit tedious. But it gets to the root of things and opens up
                  the possibility of changing thought and behavior. And then the
                  learning is leveraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's right: don't stop with the technical stuff. All change
                  has social implications for your organization, and VSM is also
                  a great tool for bringing an organization together in many
                  ways. Changing the work is just the beginning; the management
                  system also needs to adapt to the changes, because the
                  connection between the two is critical to sustaining
                  improvements.

                      important way to grow our business. All of a sudden,
