                            <p>Organizations can be mobilized and guided through a transformation of their people and processes. By empowering the day-to-day operations staff to take ownership of problem-solving, sustainable change can be achieved. Support for organizational leaders can address the link between executive management systems and everyday operating functions.</p>
