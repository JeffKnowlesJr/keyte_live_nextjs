## Project Overview: Keyte Group Website Redesign (v.2)

This document outlines the key aspects of the Keyte Group website redesign project, incorporating feedback, goals, and decisions made to date.

### I. Project Goals & Objectives:

*   Modernize the website with updated functionality and accessibility across all devices.
*   Create a user-friendly experience.
*   Showcase Beau Keyte's "givebacks," publications, and professional insights.
*   Maintain personal design elements like cartoons.
*   Create a functional site without emphasizing professional visibility or expanding consulting opportunities.

### II. Content Rewrite Direction:

*   **Shift the Content Focus:** Move away from content focused on organizational improvement. Realign the content with Beau's current priorities.
*   **Highlight Key Areas:**
	- Industry Support
	- Teaching and Writing
	- Existing Content (restructured under new navigation)
	- Redesigning Continuous Improvement (new section)
*   **Incorporate Missing Elements:**
	- Ensure the front page references Beau's second book.
	- Include two topics in the middle box/window on the homepage.
	- Add content about Beau's work redefining Lean methodology
*   **Showcase Beau's Professional Vision:**
    *   Emphasize out-of-the-box thinking, critical thinking, and coaching skills.
    *   Reflect his role as an advisor and give-back stage contributor.
    *   Highlight contemporary ideas and high engagement.
*   **Maintain Personal Touch:**
    *   Retain the cartoons and consider visual updates to them.
    *   Potentially incorporate personal stories, values, or philosophies.
*   **Address Website Structure:**
    *   Consider a static site with minimal updates, if that's Beau's preference.
    *   Organize "10-Minute Short Stops" into categories for easier exploration (e.g., Leadership Insights, Lean Fundamentals, Organizational Transformation).
    * Modify existing pages to use more generic/timeless language
*   **Tone and Style:** Maintain a tone and style appropriate for the target audience (industry professionals and educators).

### III. Key Decisions from Initial Consultation and Follow-up Meetings:

- Remove the affiliates page and speaking engagements pages.
- Incorporate information about Beau's network.
- Implement new main navigation tabs: Industry Support, Teaching and Writing, and a dropdown for existing content.
- Remove the problematic email address.
- Create four new page templates: industry support, teaching/writing, second book, and redesigning continuous improvement.
- Focus on creating new content rather than extensively revising old content.

### IV. Content Development Process:

- Content deck created with all existing website pages for easy editing
- Beau to focus on creating content for new sections rather than editing old content
- Jeff to handle tense changes and updates to existing content
- Beau to send completed Word documents as they are finished

### V. Budget:

*   Estimated budget: $2,000 – $4,000 for design and development.
*   $180 annual hosting.
*   Minimal ongoing maintenance.

### VII. Concerns:

- Content theft.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Be mindful of text volume on pages, considering mobile viewing habits.

### VIII. Action Items & Next Steps:

- Jeff to create four new page templates and add them to the content deck
