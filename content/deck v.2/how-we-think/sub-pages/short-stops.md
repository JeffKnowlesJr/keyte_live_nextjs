Short Stop #1

The Four Bedrock Questions You Should Be Asking

Four basic probing questions will help you dig deep and uncover information that will reveal the specific issues underlying an operational difficulty. In practice, they act as guardrails against settling for anecdotal evidence over data in diagnosing complex problems or rushing to solutions that may or may not be on the right track.

This inaugural webinar will introduce these foundational questions, provide examples of how they work, explore common concerns and/or additional questions, and then let you try them back in your own workplace.

If you would like some assistance adapting and applying these insights to your organization, please [contact me](https://www.keytegroup.com/contact-us/index.htm "Contact Us") to arrange an "office hour" with your teams.

H2: Short Stop #2: Finding Hidden Capacity

Lean thinking challenges an organization to examine how its resources are currently deployed. Until they are being used optimally, it's unlikely that adding resources is the best way to grow your organization in a sustainable way.

To help quantify things, the metaphor of a bucket can be used. The current "capacity" – how resources are being used in different activities -- can be visualized, and then also how they need to be used to achieve a specific operational goal. This webinar will introduce the capacity bucket, show several quick examples, and then leave you with a straightforward challenge: what do you understand about how you use your capacity today and the resource gaps that challenge your improvement efforts?

Short Stop #3

How Do the Best Leaders Avoid Being Overstretched?

Most transformative efforts require that top organizational leaders become significantly involved in championing change (with the difficult work of accepting different ways of thinking and acting). When redesigning work for most workers, showing them how to first remove work that no longer makes sense or adds value is important. Leaders should have the same opportunity.

This webinar is designed to start you on a path toward doing the right work, and only the right work, as part of your organizational transformation. It will provide you with a template for assessing your current work in a deliberate manner. It will share a process used to challenge the value of ongoing tasks, with an eye-opening example. Once you’ve worked through this process for yourself and removed work that no longer has value, you will be free to replace it with work that moves the organization forward.

Short Stop #4

Seeing Beyond A Technical Solution

When I began my lean thinking journey years ago, my clients were impressed that I could present seemingly brilliant solutions to their problems. And - truth be told - I was too often impressed with myself. It took me years to realize that my solutions were flawed; as a young engineering professional, I hadn’t recognized the human limitations of the workplace, hadn’t understood how people thought and acted within an existing organizational culture.

This webinar will focus on the social impact of change and enable you to conceptualize a socialization component to process improvement, and a simple tool to figure out who you should be talking to and what you need to talk about as you move your changes forward to better outcomes.
