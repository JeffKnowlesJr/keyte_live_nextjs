H3: Guiding Organizational Transformation

How, in a world of increasing complexity and rapid change, can you create a capable organization? Capable of innovating not just to keep up but to get ahead? The best approach involves sharing responsibility for thinking and problem-solving across all levels of the organization.

While managers might be trained to address problems throughout the organization, maintaining expertise at every level for timely action is challenging. Expertise often comes from daily experience and exists throughout the organization. However, this expertise may be underutilized if operational staff are not encouraged to think, adapt, and innovate.

Achieving continuous improvement requires enabling individuals to step back, assess issues and facts, experiment with solutions, and integrate effective practices continuously.

Engaging managers and workers directly in defining critical business problems and building the internal capacity to solve them can be more effective than standardized training programs or best-practice checklists.

The process begins with a diagnostic conversation rather than a prescription, focusing on a process rather than a quick fix. Success is achieved when external support is no longer needed.

H3: Testimonial

"The people throughout the organization have increased their ability to recognize that they have problems, and discuss and work through the problems. And, they have gone one important step further: they have created the ability to adapt new and different processes, measure them, and respond to the new process data. They are continuing to find ways to really improve."
â€” Senior executive, service industry
