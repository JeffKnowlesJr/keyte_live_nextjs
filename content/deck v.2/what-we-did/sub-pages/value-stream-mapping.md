H3: Guiding Organizational Transformation

Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a tool (set of tools and techniques) that is/are used to help people learn and change together. We’ve been mapping processes for 26 years and produced three publications on the subject; we are thought-leaders in the field.

Whether a project’s scope is small or sweeping, the fundamentals are the same. Yet the approach is never cookie-cutter. Teams are coached as they themselves diagnose system performance issues and design something better – delivering better value to the customer and making front line workers better able to do their jobs. Each team, each problem, has qualities that are unique. 

Value Stream Mapping sounds technical and it is. Perhaps even a bit tedious. But it gets to the root of things and opens up the possibility of changing thought and behavior. And then the learning is leveraged.

That’s right: don’t stop with the technical stuff. All change has social implications for your organization, and VSM is also a great tool for bringing an organization together in many ways. Changing the work is just the beginning; the management system also needs to adapt to the changes, because the connection between the two is critical to sustaining improvements.

H3: Testimonial

"A big benefit of value stream mapping is that employees understand we were committed to custom work as an important way to grow our business. All of a sudden, people were working together. It has made this a better place to work."
