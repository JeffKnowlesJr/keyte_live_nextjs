The A3 process develops managers to coach and mentor their teams, enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of individuals within those processes. This allows management to focus on broader organizational challenges.

When executives address operational issues in areas where they lack daily involvement, it can be disadvantageous for both the executives and the organization. This can detract from management's capacity to handle critical organizational development tasks and foster a reliance on management for problem-solving at the front line.

Management can be enabled to coach operational staff, ensuring problems are addressed at the appropriate level. This involves a collaborative learning model that leverages insights from various parts of the organization.

H5: Operational

Band-aid here, band-aid there, and another, and another, and another. Under pressure of daily activity, we’ve all been trained to make – and probably gotten rewarded for – quick fixes when problems pop up. But what a mess we sometimes get into, solving familiar problems over and over again. Our capacity for superb customer service and business growth can erode imperceptibly while we are “too busy” to get to the bottom of things.

“A3” thinking – referencing an industry term for the 11 x 17 sheet of paper which serves as the collection point for data and analysis – can turn things around. While one-time training workshops are useful, a progressive learning model, working with several teams in an organization over a series of weeks to allow them time to engage others, gather solid supporting data, and learn how to identify the actionable issue(s) has been found to be the best intervention.

With this technique an organization’s internal capacity for :

- Aligning all functions around key strategic performance goals
- Understanding systemic problems and solving them
- Creating a solid force of front line thinking and problem solving
- Continuous improvement
